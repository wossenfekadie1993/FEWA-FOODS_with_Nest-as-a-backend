WE USED POSTGRESQL BECAUSE OF IT'S Scalability: PostgreSQL is highly scalable, both in terms of data storage and performance. It can handle large amounts of data and support concurrent users and transactions, is open source, which means that it is free to use and there is a large community of developers who contribute to its development and improvement.
